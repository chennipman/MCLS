/* Notes									*/
/* The volume of fluid field is advected using an operator splitting technique  */
/* that is explained in both Sander's thesis as in the papers of Sussman        */
/* and is first order accurate. The contributions of fluxes in the different    */
/* directions are added one after the other. To circumvent any directional      */
/* dependence, to order in which the fluxes are added is changed every time     */
/* with 3 spatial directions there are 3!=6 possible orderings.                 */
/* Six orderings are defined, and after ordering 6 is applied the process starts*/
/* over again.									*/
/* Note that after each flux computation, the changes in the intermediate       */
/* volume of fluid fields have to be accounted for in changes in corresponding  */
/* level set fields.								*/
